# KindeyStone_Classifier_Binary_Classification

This is a machine learning project which classify the person as having kidney stone or not on the basis of person's urea, 
conductivity of urea, pH level, etc. Data set is used from kaggle, and code is written from scratch. 
First data is loaded, and explored using pandas, and then EDA is performed to gain as much as possible insights about data.
Four different type of classifiers are made. Data is preprocessed and numerical features are normalized. Whole process is streamlined
 using pipelines.
 
 Thanks, and regards.
